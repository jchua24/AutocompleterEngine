"""CSC148 Assignment 2: Autocompleter classes

=== CSC148 Fall 2018 ===
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module Description ===
This file contains the design of a public interface (Autocompleter) and two
implementation of this interface, SimplePrefixTree and CompressedPrefixTree.
You'll complete both of these subclasses over the course of this assignment.

As usual, be sure not to change any parts of the given *public interface* in the
starter code---and this includes the instance attributes, which we will be
testing directly! You may, however, add new private attributes, methods, and
top-level functions to this file.

class SimplePrefixTree(Autocompleter):
    """A simple prefix tree.

    This class follows the implementation described on the assignment handout.
    Note that we've made the attributes public because we will be accessing them
    directly for testing purposes.

    === Attributes ===
    value:
        The value stored at the root of this prefix tree, or [] if this
        prefix tree is empty.
    weight:
        The weight of this prefix tree. If this tree is a leaf, this attribute
        stores the weight of the value stored in the leaf. If this tree is
        not a leaf and non-empty, this attribute stores the *aggregate weight*
        of the leaf weights in this tree.
    subtrees:
        A list of subtrees of this prefix tree.

    === Representation invariants ===
    - self.weight >= 0

    - (EMPTY TREE):
        If self.weight == 0, then self.value == [] and self.subtrees == [].
        This represents an empty simple prefix tree.
    - (LEAF):
        If self.subtrees == [] and self.weight > 0, this tree is a leaf.
        (self.value is a value that was inserted into this tree.)
    - (NON-EMPTY, NON-LEAF):
        If len(self.subtrees) > 0, then self.value is a list (*common prefix*),
        and self.weight > 0 (*aggregate weight*).

    - ("prefixes grow by 1")
      If len(self.subtrees) > 0, and subtree in self.subtrees, and subtree
      is non-empty and not a leaf, then

          subtree.value == self.value + [x], for some element x

    - self.subtrees does not contain any empty prefix trees.
    - self.subtrees is *sorted* in non-increasing order of their weights.
      (You can break ties any way you like.)
      Note that this applies to both leaves and non-leaf subtrees:
      both can appear in the same self.subtrees list, and both have a `weight`
      attribute.

    (including the initializer!) this version follows the implementation

    === Attributes ===
    value:
        The value stored at the root of this prefix tree, or [] if this
        prefix tree is empty.
    weight:
        The weight of this prefix tree. If this tree is a leaf, this attribute
        stores the weight of the value stored in the leaf. If this tree is
        not a leaf and non-empty, this attribute stores the *aggregate weight*

    subtrees:

    - **NEW**
      This tree does not contain any compressible internal values.
      (See the assignment handout for a definition of "compressible".)

    - self.subtrees does not contain any empty prefix trees.
